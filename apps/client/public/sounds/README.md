# Sound Effects

Place the following sound files in this directory:

- **hop.mp3** - Short click/tap sound (~50ms) played each time the piece lands on an intermediate space during movement animation.
- **land.mp3** - Deeper thud sound (~200ms) played when the piece reaches its final destination.

The game will work without these files - sounds are optional and errors are handled gracefully.
